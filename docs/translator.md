# The translator: how it is tested

The translator turns the game's PowerPC code into C (see `pc-port.md`). The risk is not in writing it but in **getting a thousand
small meanings exactly right**: what `srawi` does to the carry bit, what `divw` gives for a zero, what `fmadds` does with a NaN. A mistake
there makes a game that runs and is subtly wrong. So the meaning of each instruction is checked against something that is not this
project's understanding of it.

## The reference interpreter (`mh3u-ppc`, `interp.rs`)

One core, no interrupts, no address translation: the *meaning* of each instruction in plain Rust, small enough to read against the
architecture book. It is what everything else is compared with. Not modelled: the floating point status register's exception bits (the
game's code never touches the register: spike 2), the hardware's estimate tables for `fres` and `frsqrte` (the exact reciprocal is used,
within the hardware's stated error), and the privileged and 64-bit instructions (the game uses none).

## QEMU as the oracle (`crates/mh3u-ppc/tests/`)

`qemu-ppc-static` (QEMU's user-mode PowerPC emulator, `-cpu 750`) is an independent implementation of the instruction set. The tests
build a small static 32-bit big-endian ELF for each case, with no linker: a stub loads a whole register state (32 GPRs, 32 FPRs, CR, XER,
LR, CTR and 256 bytes of scratch memory) from an array, runs the instruction under test, saves the state, and loops over the cases; at the
end it writes the arrays to standard output. The same states are run on the interpreter and the results compared bit for bit.

- `qemu_sanity.rs`: the harness itself (a known program, the state round trip, the loader).
- `qemu_diff.rs`: **every instruction** (the 1,250 or so words are random operands for each of about 150 instructions, 24 random states each
  with values chosen from the edge cases: 0, 1, -1, 0x7fffffff, 0x80000000, shift counts of 31, 32, 33, 63, 64; for floating point
  zeros, infinities, denormals, NaNs), every branch form with every kind of `BO`, the reservation pair, and the estimate instructions.
  The tests skip when QEMU is not installed.
- What it found in the interpreter: `lswi`/`lswx` cleared a register it should not have touched, and `lfs` made a signalling NaN quiet where the
  hardware only moves the fields. Both are fixed; the rest agreed from the start.

What QEMU does not check: the **paired singles** (QEMU has none), and the instructions it treats as illegal on the 750 (`fsqrt`, `fsqrts`:
the game does not use them). Their meaning has to come from the architecture book, and a second check (from the game itself: Cemu's
memory, see `docs/spikes.md`) is planned.

## Not tested against QEMU, with the reason

`mftb` (the time base moves), the floating point status register (not modelled), the traps `tw`/`twi`/`sc` (they stop the program: unit
tests), `lmw` (it overwrites the registers the harness needs), the privileged ones, `eciwx`/`ecowx`, the 64-bit ones, `fres`/`frsqrte`
(only closeness).
